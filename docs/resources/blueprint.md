# resourcely_blueprint (Resource)

A blueprint is a configuration template used to provision cloud infrastructure resources. Blueprints allow you to:

- Define which options are available for properties of your resource(s).
- Apply gaurdrails to your resource(s) to prevent misconfiguration.
- Define what information to collect from your developers before provisioning the resource.

Once a blueprint is configured and published, it becomes available for use in your Resourcely service catalog.

The template is specified using Resourcely's TFT templating language. See the [Authoring Your Own Blueprints](https://docs.resourcely.io/build/setting-up-blueprints/authoring-your-own-blueprints) docs for details about TFT. The [Resourcely Foundry](https://portal.resourcely.io/foundry?mode=blueprint) provides an IDE to assist with authoring the template.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "resourcely_blueprint" "private_s3_bucket" {
  name        = "Private S3 Bucket"
  description = "Creates a private, S3 bucket with configuration versioning."

  cloud_provider = "PROVIDER_AMAZON"
  categories     = ["BLUEPRINT_BLOB_STORAGE"]

  is_published = true

  content = <<-EOT
    ---
    constants:
      __name: "{{ bucket }}_{{ __guid }}"
    ---
    resource "aws_s3_" "{{ __name }}" {
      bucket = {{ bucket }}
    }

    resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "{{ __name }}" {
      bucket = aws_s3_bucket.{{ __name }}.id

      block_public_acls       = true
      block_public_policy     = true
      ignore_public_acls      = true
      restrict_public_buckets = true
    }

    resource "aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls" "{{ __name }}" {
      bucket = aws_s3_bucket.{{ __name }}.id

      rule {
        object_ownership = "BucketOwnerEnforced"
      }
    }
  EOT
}
